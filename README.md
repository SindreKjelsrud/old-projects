# Old Projects Repo

## Info

This repo contains some of my older projects / projects I feel like doesn't need it's own repository anymore.

Here is a short table with an oversight over each project with a description:

| Project Name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Cookie Clicker | This is one of my first projects. I got some help from YouTube of course. I made it during my first year on my bachelor (~2021), and it was fun to make.                                                                                                         |
| v1-kjelsrud.dev | I made this while on a trainride back to Bergen in 2021. Had watched a lot of YouTube videos about people having their own website, so I wanted to try it out myself. Was fun to mess around with HTML and CSS, as I was not quite good at it hehe               |
| BTSI_nettside  | This was a quick Hugo project made for a new customer that my studentorg, [friByte](https:fribyte.no), had gotten in 2023. It was fun to make, but we went with a WordPress site instead, which I had never tried before. So got some experience with that also! |
| Praksisblogg | This was a blogsite for a course I took at school. It was a Hugo project, which is unfinished because I had to change to another platform.. |
| v2-kjelsrud.dev | This was my first ever SSG project. This learned me a ton of stuff, especially Git. Hugo is love <3 |
| sidskipedia | This was a wikipedia site for my own stuff. Moved this over to my website instead of a subdomain. |
