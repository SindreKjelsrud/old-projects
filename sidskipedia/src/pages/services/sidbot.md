## Info
This is a Discord bot made by me with JavaScript.

## Installation
When cloning the repository for the first time, you must run an `npm install` to download the correct dependencies.

## bot.sh - Script
This script is designed to launch the bot as quickly as possible on the server. (Not the longest script but saves a few seconds lol.)

```
cd sidBot-js/
node.
```

## TODO()
- [ ] Fix Github Actions so it r'syncs to my server on updates.
